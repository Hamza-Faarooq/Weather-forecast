# Weather-forecast

- A simple weather forecast app using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API. 
- This app takes a city name as input from the user and displays the current weather conditions for that city.
- Before running the code, make sure you have signed up for the OpenWeatherMap API and obtained an API key. 
- Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key in the code.
- This code defines a function get_weather() to fetch weather data for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
- The main() function takes user input for the city name, calls the get_weather() function, and displays the current weather conditions including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
More features are:

**Error handling for invalid input and network issues**

**Displaying additional weather information such as pressure and visibility.**

**Providing an option for users to see the forecast for the next few days.**

**Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for a user-friendly experience**

**In this version of the app, I've replaced the command-line interface with a simple Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI)**.

**Users can input the city name in a text entry field and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the weather information correspondingly.**


## Window Geometry: 
**We have set the window geometry to 400x300 pixels to provide a more compact and aesthetically pleasing layout.**
